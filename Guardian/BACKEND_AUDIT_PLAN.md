# Backend Architecture Audit Plan — ✅ COMPLETED

> **Created:** S60 (2026-03-06) | **Completed:** S64 (2026-03-06)
> **Result:** 4 phases, 59 findings, 58 fixed, 1 deferred (rate limiting)

---

## Why This Audit

- App is LIVE on AWS (EC2 + RDS PostgreSQL)
- Real data entry starts tomorrow
- Current backend was built iteratively over 59 sessions — needs a single pass to ensure it's professional-grade
- Poor queries = high CPU, slow responses, wrong data
- Missing indexes = table scans on 10K+ rows
- Missing constraints = corrupted data that's impossible to fix later
- Non-atomic transactions = partial saves, orphaned records

---

## Scope: 24 Models, 16 Services, 17 Route Files

### Phase 1: Database Structure Audit
**What:** Review all 24 models in `backend/app/models/`
**Looking for:**
- Missing indexes on columns used in WHERE/ORDER BY/JOIN (supplier_id, status, roll_code, lot_id, etc.)
- Missing UNIQUE constraints (roll_code is unique, but is batch_code? lot_code? challan_no?)
- Missing CHECK constraints (weight > 0, status in valid set, piece_count > 0)
- FK cascade rules — what happens when a supplier is deleted? Does it cascade to rolls?
- Decimal precision — is Numeric(10,3) enough for weights? Is Numeric(10,2) enough for costs?
- String lengths — is String(50) enough for roll_code with VA suffixes?
- Nullable columns that shouldn't be nullable (or vice versa)
- Missing relationships that would simplify queries

**Files:** `backend/app/models/*.py` (24 files), `backend/app/database.py`

### Phase 2: Query Efficiency Audit
**What:** Review all 16 services in `backend/app/services/`
**Looking for:**
- N+1 query patterns (loop that does a query per iteration)
- Missing `selectinload` / `joinedload` causing lazy loads (SQLAlchemy async doesn't support lazy)
- "Fetch all then filter in Python" when SQL WHERE would do
- "Fetch all then sort in Python" when SQL ORDER BY would do
- "Fetch all then paginate in Python" when SQL OFFSET/LIMIT would do
- Heavy aggregations done in Python instead of SQL (COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY)
- Redundant queries (same data fetched twice in one request)
- Missing `.unique()` on queries with `selectinload` (causes duplicates)

**Files:** `backend/app/services/*.py` (16 files)

### Phase 3: Data Flow Integrity Audit
**What:** Trace the complete lifecycle of a roll from stock-in to packed garment
**Looking for:**
- Weight transitions: total_weight (immutable) vs current_weight vs remaining_weight — are all mutations correct?
- Status transitions: roll (in_stock -> sent_for_processing -> in_stock -> in_cutting) — are guards enforced?
- Batch state machine: 7 states (created -> assigned -> in_progress -> submitted -> checked -> packing -> packed) — are transitions atomic?
- VA guard: can't submit/pack batch if BatchProcessing has status='sent' — is this enforced?
- Lot forward-only: open -> cutting -> distributed — can you go backwards?
- Job Challan atomicity: challan + all roll sends in single transaction?
- Batch Challan atomicity: challan + all batch processing records in single transaction?
- Concurrent access: two users send same roll for processing simultaneously — race condition on remaining_weight?
- Partial failure: if roll 15 of 30 fails in bulk stock-in, do first 14 persist? (Should NOT with our new atomic endpoint)

**Flow to trace:**
```
Supplier Invoice -> Stock-In (bulk rolls)
  -> Send for VA (Job Challan) -> Receive from VA
  -> Create Lot (assign rolls) -> Cut (status change)
  -> Distribute Lot (auto-create batches)
  -> Assign Batch (to tailor) -> Start -> Submit
  -> Send for Garment VA (Batch Challan) -> Receive
  -> QC Check -> Ready for Packing -> Pack
  -> SKU auto-gen -> Ready Stock
```

**Files:** All 16 services, focusing on `roll_service.py`, `lot_service.py`, `batch_service.py`, `job_challan_service.py`, `batch_challan_service.py`

### Phase 4: Production Readiness Audit
**What:** Config, connection pooling, error handling, security
**Looking for:**
- Database connection pool config (pool_size, max_overflow, pool_timeout)
- Transaction isolation level — default or explicit?
- Error handling — do services catch DB errors or let them bubble as 500s?
- Alembic migration state — is it clean for production?
- Environment config — are secrets in .env? Is DEBUG off?
- CORS — production-only origins?
- Rate limiting — any protection against abuse?
- Request size limits — can someone POST a 10MB payload?
- Logging — structured logs for debugging production issues?

**Files:** `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/database.py`, `backend/app/core/`, `.env`

## Output Format

Each finding will be:

| # | Severity | File:Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|-----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | CRITICAL | models/roll.py:16 | No index on `status` column — table scan on every `GET /rolls?status=in_stock` | Add `index=True` to column def |

**Severity levels:**
- **CRITICAL** — Will cause wrong data or crash under load. Fix before real data entry.
- **HIGH** — Performance will degrade noticeably at 1K+ records. Fix within first week.
- **MEDIUM** — Best practice violation. Fix when convenient.
- **LOW** — Nice to have. Defer.

## Phase 1: Database Structure — AUDITED (S60) + FIXED (S61)

All 24 models reviewed (S60). All 26 issues fixed and deployed to production (S61).

**Fix details:** 11 model files edited, 1 Alembic migration created (`s61_db_hardening`).
**Deploy:** Tables dropped + recreated + re-seeded on PostgreSQL (production had only master data).
**Commit:** `7d54969` — pushed to GitHub, pulled on EC2, FastAPI restarted.
**Verified:** `pg_indexes` and `pg_constraint` queries confirm all indexes/constraints present.

All 26 issues found:

### CRITICAL (4) — ✅ ALL FIXED

| # | File:Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|-----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | `roll.py:25` | `status` column — NO index. Every `GET /rolls?status=in_stock` full table scan. Hottest query in the app. | Add `index=True` to `status` column |
| 2 | `roll.py:26` | `supplier_invoice_no` — NO index. `get_supplier_invoices` loads ALL rolls. At 10K+ rolls this dominates CPU. | Add `index=True` |
| 3 | `roll.py:32` | `supplier_id` FK — NO index. Supplier filter scans entire rolls table. | Add `index=True` |
| 4 | `roll.py:19` | `total_weight` Numeric — NO check constraint. Zero/negative weight can be inserted via bug or direct DB. Corrupted data is unfixable. | Add `CheckConstraint('total_weight > 0', name='ck_rolls_positive_weight')` |

### HIGH (7) — ✅ ALL FIXED

| # | File:Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|-----------|-------|-----|
| 5 | `roll.py:29` | `sr_no` — NO index. Filtered in `RollFilterParams`, used in label printing after stock-in. | Add `index=True` |
| 6 | `roll.py:25` | `status` — NO CHECK constraint. Any string like `"in_stok"` silently accepted. | Add `CheckConstraint("status IN ('in_stock','sent_for_processing','in_cutting')")` |
| 7 | `batch.py:22` | `status` — has index but NO CHECK. 7-state machine not enforced at DB level. | Add `CheckConstraint` for 7 valid states |
| 8 | `lot.py:30-31` | `status` — has index but NO CHECK. Should be `open`/`cutting`/`distributed` only. | Add `CheckConstraint` |
| 9 | `supplier.py:27` | `Supplier.rolls` rel — NO `ondelete` rule on Roll FK. Supplier delete → orphaned rolls or FK violation. | Add `ondelete="RESTRICT"` on `Roll.supplier_id` FK |
| 10 | `lot.py:46-47` | `LotRoll.lot_id` / `LotRoll.roll_id` — NO `ondelete`. Lot delete → orphan lot_rolls. Roll delete while in lot → orphan. | Add `ondelete="CASCADE"` on lot_id, `ondelete="RESTRICT"` on roll_id |
| 11 | `batch.py:16` | `Batch.lot_id` — NO `ondelete`. Lot delete → orphan batches. | Add `ondelete="RESTRICT"` |

### MEDIUM (11) — ✅ ALL FIXED

| # | File:Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|-----------|-------|-----|
| 12 | `roll.py:52` (RollProcessing) | `roll_id` FK — NO explicit index. `selectinload(Roll.processing_logs)` needs this. | Add `index=True` |
| 13 | `roll.py:67` (RollProcessing) | `job_challan_id` FK — NO index. | Add `index=True` |
| 14 | `batch_assignment.py:15` | `batch_id` FK — NO index. Loading `batch.assignments`. | Add `index=True` |
| 15 | `batch_assignment.py:16` | `tailor_id` FK — NO index. `getMyBatches` filters by tailor. | Add `index=True` |
| 16 | `batch_roll_consumption.py:16` | `batch_id` FK — NO index. | Add `index=True` |
| 17 | `batch_roll_consumption.py:17` | `roll_id` FK — NO index. Consumption history lookup. | Add `index=True` |
| 18 | `order.py:17` | `source` column — NO index. Filtered in `OrderFilterParams`. | Add `index=True` |
| 19 | `order_item.py:15` | `order_id` FK — NO index. | Add `index=True` |
| 20 | `order_item.py:16` | `sku_id` FK — NO index. | Add `index=True` |
| 21 | `batch.py:19` | `quantity` — NO check > 0. | Add `CheckConstraint('quantity > 0')` |
| 22 | `batch_processing.py:31` | `pieces_sent` — NO check > 0. | Add `CheckConstraint('pieces_sent > 0')` |

### LOW (4) — ✅ ALL FIXED

| # | File:Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|-----------|-------|-----|
| 23 | `invoice.py:17` | `order_id` FK — NO index. | Add `index=True` |
| 24 | `invoice_item.py:15` | `invoice_id` FK — NO index. | Add `index=True` |
| 25 | `inventory_event.py:23` | `roll_id` FK — NO index. | Add `index=True` |
| 26 | `roll.py:16` | `roll_code` String(50) — with VA suffixes like `1-COT-PINK/07-01+EMB+DYE+SQN` that's ~35 chars. Tight if many VAs. | Consider String(80) |

### Already Good (10 items)

- Batch: `status`, `lot_id`, `sku_id`, `size` — all indexed
- BatchProcessing: `batch_id`, `batch_challan_id`, `value_addition_id`, `status` — all indexed
- BatchChallan: `challan_no`, `value_addition_id`, `status` — all indexed
- Lot: `status`, `sku_id` — indexed. LotRoll: `lot_id`, `roll_id` — indexed
- All unique codes: `roll_code`, `batch_code`, `lot_code`, `challan_no`, `sku_code`, `order_number` — unique=True
- Naming convention for constraints (Alembic-friendly)
- PostgreSQL pool: `pool_size=10`, `max_overflow=20`
- `DateTime(timezone=True)` on `created_at` — asyncpg compatible

## Phase 3 Findings: Data Flow Integrity — AUDITED + FIXED (S63)

All 5 key services audited. 9 issues found and fixed.

**Fix details:** 9 files edited. Zero response shape changes. SQLite dev compatibility preserved.
**Key wins:**
- Race condition protection: `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on all roll weight mutations (PostgreSQL)
- DB constraint: `remaining_weight >= 0` CHECK on Roll model
- Lot state machine: removed `status` from `LotUpdate` schema (can't bypass via PATCH)
- Sequence collision: all code generators + challan numbers use row-level locking on PostgreSQL
- Roll edit guard: now checks processing history + lot assignments, not just weight comparison
- Status preservation: `receive_from_processing` no longer overrides `in_cutting` status

### CRITICAL (2) — ✅ ALL FIXED

| # | File | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|------|-------|-----|--------|
| P3-1 | `roll_service.py`, `lot_service.py`, `job_challan_service.py` | No `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on `remaining_weight` before deduction — race condition | Added `with_for_update()` on all critical roll reads (PostgreSQL only, no-op on SQLite) | ✅ FIXED |
| P3-2 | `models/roll.py` | No CHECK constraint `remaining_weight >= 0` — negative weight persists silently | Added `CheckConstraint("remaining_weight >= 0", name="non_negative_remaining")` | ✅ FIXED |

### HIGH (3) — ✅ ALL FIXED

| # | File | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|------|-------|-----|--------|

| P3-4 | `code_generator.py`, `lot_service.py`, `job_challan_service.py`, `batch_challan_service.py` | Sequence collision — `SELECT MAX + 1` race on concurrent requests | Changed to `ORDER BY DESC LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE` on PostgreSQL; UNIQUE constraint safety net | ✅ FIXED |
| P3-5 | `roll_service.py:512` | `update_roll()` guard passes after full VA cycle (remaining == current) | Added check for processing_logs and lot_rolls count > 0 | ✅ FIXED |

### MEDIUM (2) — ✅ ALL FIXED

| # | File | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|------|-------|-----|--------|
| P3-6 | `batch_service.py:134` | `update_batch()` uses `db.commit()` instead of `db.flush()` | Changed to `db.flush()`, removed `db.refresh()` (pattern matches all other services) | ✅ FIXED |
| P3-7 | `roll_service.py:670` | `receive_from_processing` resets `in_cutting` to `in_stock` when VA returns | Now only transitions from `sent_for_processing` → `in_stock`; preserves `in_cutting` | ✅ FIXED |

### LOW (2) — ✅ ALL FIXED

| # | File | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|------|-------|-----|--------|
| P3-8 | `lot_service.py:182` | `add_roll_to_lot()` only allows `"open"` status — correct but noted | No change needed — behavior is correct | ✅ REVIEWED |
| P3-9 | `batch_challan_service.py:127` | SSE emit accesses `challan.batch_items` before eager reload | Changed to use `total_pieces` (already computed from request data) | ✅ FIXED |
