# Inventory-OS — Project Session Log

## Quick Resume: Say "continue project" to pick up where we left off.

### Start Here
1. `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. `cd frontend && npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173
3. **Production:** `https://inventory.drsblouse.com` (Vercel ✅) + `https://api-inventory.drsblouse.com` (AWS EC2 ✅)
4. Login: `admin` → `/dashboard` | `tailor1` → `/my-work` | `checker1` → `/qc-queue`

## Current State (Session 63 — 2026-03-06)

### S63: Phase 3 Data Flow Integrity — ALL 9 Findings Fixed

**Race condition protection, state machine hardening, weight mutation safety.**

| Fix | Area | Before | After |
|-----|------|--------|-------|
| P3-1 (CRITICAL) | Roll weight race | No row locking — concurrent ops can double-spend weight | `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on all roll weight mutations (PostgreSQL) |
| P3-2 (CRITICAL) | Roll model | No CHECK on remaining_weight — negative persists silently | `CheckConstraint("remaining_weight >= 0")` |
| P3-3 (HIGH) | Lot state machine | `LotUpdate` includes `status` — bypasses state machine | Removed `status` from `LotUpdate` schema |
| P3-4 (HIGH) | Code generators | `SELECT MAX + 1` race — concurrent calls get same code | `ORDER BY DESC LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE` on PostgreSQL |
| P3-5 (HIGH) | Roll edit guard | Guard passes after full VA cycle (remaining == current) | Now checks processing_logs + lot_rolls count |
| P3-6 (MEDIUM) | Batch update | `db.commit()` breaks transaction pattern | Changed to `db.flush()` |
| P3-7 (MEDIUM) | Roll VA receive | `in_cutting` status overwritten to `in_stock` on VA return | Only transitions from `sent_for_processing` |
| P3-8 (LOW) | Lot add_roll | Only allows "open" — reviewed, correct | No change needed |
| P3-9 (LOW) | Batch challan SSE | Accesses `batch_items` before eager reload | Uses `total_pieces` from request data |

#### Files Changed (9 files)
- `backend/app/database.py` — `is_postgresql()` helper
- `backend/app/models/roll.py` — CHECK constraint `remaining_weight >= 0`
- `backend/app/schemas/lot.py` — Removed `status` from `LotUpdate`
- `backend/app/core/code_generator.py` — `_max_code()` helper with FOR UPDATE
- `backend/app/services/roll_service.py` — FOR UPDATE + better edit guard + status preservation
- `backend/app/services/lot_service.py` — FOR UPDATE on all roll mutations + distribute_lot
- `backend/app/services/job_challan_service.py` — FOR UPDATE on challan number + roll reads
- `backend/app/services/batch_challan_service.py` — FOR UPDATE on challan number + SSE fix
- `backend/app/services/batch_service.py` — `commit()` → `flush()`

### NEXT SESSION: S63 — Phase 3 Data Flow Integrity Audit

**Already read for Phase 3 (don't re-read):**
- `roll_service.py` — FULL (send/receive processing, weight mutations, update_processing_log)
- `batch_service.py` — FULL (7-state machine, VA guard, pack→SKU auto-gen)
- `batch_challan_service.py` — FULL (create/receive challan, phase tracking)
- `lot_service.py` — FULL (create_lot, distribute_lot, add/remove roll)
- `job_challan_service.py` — FULL (atomic challan + bulk roll send)
- All models: `roll.py`, `batch.py`, `lot.py` — FULL (constraints, FKs, relationships)

**Phase 3 Audit Checklist — trace the full lifecycle:**

1. **Weight Mutations (Roll)**
   - `total_weight` — IMMUTABLE after stock-in ✅ (only set in stock_in/bulk_stock_in)
   - `current_weight` — mutated by receive_from_processing (VA delta) + update_processing_log
   - `remaining_weight` — mutated by send/receive processing + lot creation
   - **CHECK:** Is `remaining_weight` ever negative? Is `current_weight` ever inconsistent?
   - **CHECK:** Race condition: two concurrent send_for_processing on same roll — both read same remaining_weight, both deduct → negative remaining

2. **Roll Status Transitions**
   - Valid: `in_stock` → `sent_for_processing` (when remaining=0) → `in_stock` (when received back)
   - Valid: `in_stock` → `in_cutting` (when lot consumes all remaining)
   - **CHECK:** Can a roll in `sent_for_processing` be added to a lot? (Should NOT)
   - **CHECK:** Can a roll in `in_cutting` be sent for processing? (Should NOT)

3. **Lot Status Forward-Only**
   - `open` → `cutting` (first batch created) → `distributed` (distribute_lot)
   - **CHECK:** Can status go backwards? Any code path that resets to `open`?

4. **Batch 7-State Machine**
   - created → assigned → in_progress → submitted → checked → packing → packed
   - Full reject: checked → in_progress (rework)
   - **CHECK:** Every transition has status guard? No skip possible?
   - **CHECK:** VA guard (can't submit/pack if pending VA) — enforced consistently?

5. **Atomicity**
   - Job Challan: create challan + send all rolls in single flush ✅
   - Batch Challan: create challan + create BatchProcessing records in single flush ✅
   - Bulk stock-in: all-or-nothing ✅
   - Lot distribute: all batches + status change in single flush ✅
   - **CHECK:** Are there any multi-step operations that could leave partial state on error?

6. **Concurrent Access (CRITICAL)**
   - No SELECT FOR UPDATE on roll.remaining_weight before deduction
   - Two users sending same roll for VA simultaneously → race condition
   - Two users creating lots with same roll → race condition on remaining_weight
   - **This is the biggest risk** — needs investigation

**Priority 2: Phase 4 — Production Readiness**
- `database.py` — connection pool config, isolation level
- `main.py` — error handling, CORS, middleware
- `.env` — secrets management

**Reference:** `Guardian/BACKEND_AUDIT_PLAN.md`

---

## Previous State (Session 60 — 2026-03-06)

### S60: Backend Invoice Layer + Database Architecture Audit

**P2: Bulk Stock-In + Supplier Invoices (2 new endpoints)**
- `POST /rolls/bulk-stock-in` — atomic bulk create (all-or-nothing, single transaction). Replaces frontend loop of 30 individual POSTs. Tested: 3 rolls created, validation (weight=0, empty rolls), cleanup.
- `GET /rolls/supplier-invoices` — server-side grouping by `(supplier_invoice_no, supplier_id)` with search (invoice_no, challan_no, sr_no, supplier name, fabric, color, roll_code) + pagination. Replaces client-side fetch-all-and-group. Tested: 8 groups, search, pagination.
- Backend: `BulkStockIn`/`SupplierInvoiceParams` schemas, `bulk_stock_in()`/`get_supplier_invoices()` service methods, 2 routes before `/{roll_id}` (no UUID conflict)
- Frontend: `stockInBulk()` real path → single POST, `getInvoices()` real path → single GET
- API_REFERENCE.md updated with both endpoint shapes

**P1: Mock vs Real Audit — ALL 17 API FILES VERIFIED**
- Read every frontend API file + every backend Pydantic schema
- Field-by-field comparison: mock payload vs backend schema
- Result: **Zero mismatches found**. All schemas match. Only issues were the 2 fixed in P2.

**Phase 1: Database Structure Audit — 26 findings**
- Reviewed all 24 models in `backend/app/models/`
- 4 CRITICAL: Roll table missing indexes on `status`, `supplier_invoice_no`, `supplier_id` + no weight CHECK constraint
- 7 HIGH: Missing CHECK constraints on status fields (roll/batch/lot) + missing FK cascade rules (supplier, lot_roll, batch)
- 11 MEDIUM: Missing FK indexes on join tables + quantity checks
- 4 LOW: Minor FK indexes + roll_code String length
- Full findings documented in `Guardian/BACKEND_AUDIT_PLAN.md`

#### Files Changed
- `backend/app/schemas/roll.py` — +BulkRollEntry, +BulkStockIn, +SupplierInvoiceParams
- `backend/app/services/roll_service.py` — +bulk_stock_in(), +get_supplier_invoices()
- `backend/app/api/rolls.py` — +2 routes (bulk-stock-in, supplier-invoices)
- `frontend/src/api/rolls.js` — stockInBulk real→atomic, getInvoices real→server-side
- `Guardian/API_REFERENCE.md` — +2 endpoint docs
- `Guardian/BACKEND_AUDIT_PLAN.md` — NEW: audit plan + Phase 1 findings

---

### NEXT SESSION: S61 — Fix Phase 1 Findings + Phase 2 Audit

**Priority 1: Fix all 26 Phase 1 DB findings via Alembic migration**
- Add indexes: Roll.status, Roll.supplier_invoice_no, Roll.supplier_id, Roll.sr_no, RollProcessing.roll_id, RollProcessing.job_challan_id, BatchAssignment.batch_id/tailor_id, BatchRollConsumption.batch_id/roll_id, Order.source, OrderItem.order_id/sku_id, Invoice.order_id, InvoiceItem.invoice_id, InventoryEvent.roll_id
- Add CHECK constraints: Roll.total_weight > 0, Roll.status IN (...), Batch.status IN (...), Lot.status IN (...), Batch.quantity > 0, BatchProcessing.pieces_sent > 0
- Add ondelete rules: Roll.supplier_id RESTRICT, LotRoll.lot_id CASCADE, LotRoll.roll_id RESTRICT, Batch.lot_id RESTRICT
- Single Alembic migration for all changes
- Deploy to AWS RDS

**Priority 2: Phase 2 — Query Efficiency Audit**
- Review all 16 services for N+1 queries, fetch-all-then-filter, missing selectinload, redundant queries
- Focus on: roll_service (hottest), lot_service (complex joins), batch_service (7-state), dashboard_service (aggregations)
- Document findings same format as Phase 1

**Priority 3: Phase 3+4 if tokens allow**
- Phase 3: Data flow integrity (weight transitions, state machine atomicity, race conditions)
- Phase 4: Production readiness (logging, error handling, security)

**Reference:** `Guardian/BACKEND_AUDIT_PLAN.md` for full findings table

## Previous State (Session 59 — 2026-03-06)

### S59: Stock-In Bug Blitz + Compact ERP UI

**Critical production bugs found and fixed in the Rolls stock-in flow.**

#### Bugs Fixed (7 total)
1. **`getInvoices` page_size override** (ROOT CAUSE) — caller's `page_size:20` overrode internal `page_size:500` via JS spread. Only 20 of 30 rolls loaded. First colors gone, roll counts wrong. Fix: strip caller pagination, fetch ALL rolls via paginated loop, no hard ceiling
2. **NaN weight passthrough in edit mode** — `parseFloat('') = NaN`, `NaN <= 0` is false → empty weights sent to backend → 422. Fix: `if (!(wt > 0))` catches NaN/zero/negative
3. **rIdx misalignment** — separate counter `rIdx` vs weight index caused wrong rollId mapping. Fix: use `wI` (weight array index) directly for `rollIds[wI]` lookup
4. **`[object Object]` error messages** — FastAPI 422 returns `detail` as array of objects, not string. Fix: `stringifyDetail()` helper in both `stockInBulk` and edit error handlers
5. **Ctrl+S stale state** — focused input's onChange not fired before save. Fix: `blur()` + `setTimeout(50ms)` before `handleStockIn`
6. **Color reordering on re-edit** — backend returns rolls `created_at DESC`, colors appeared in reverse entry order. Fix: sort rolls `created_at ASC` in both `getInvoices` and `openEditInvoice`
7. **`removeWeight` orphan rolls** — deleting a weight cell in edit mode didn't track the rollId for deletion. Fix: push to `removedRollIds` before removing (mirrors `removeColorRow` pattern)

#### Data Integrity Fixes
- **Invoice search** — was broken on real backend (`search` param ignored). Now full client-side search: invoice_no, challan_no, sr_no, supplier name, fabric, color, roll_code
- **Invoice grouping collision** — two suppliers with same invoice no. merged. Key changed: `invoice_no` → `invoice_no__supplier_id`
- **Quick Master color picker** — `QuickMasterModal` now shows native color picker + hex text input for color creation (was saving black hex by default)
- **Color numbers** — updated all 26 colors in production DB with `color_no` 1-26

#### UI Compact (ERP-style)
- Labels: 11px uppercase semibold, inputs: py-1 px-2, cards: px-3 py-2
- Section gaps: space-y-2, grid gaps: gap-2, weight inputs: 80px
- ~40% less vertical space — proper wholesale data entry density

#### Commits
- `33bffbb` — NaN/rIdx/error/Ctrl+S/color-order fixes
- `57e4049` — Quick Master color picker
- `9ee30eb` — Compact ERP UI
- `3f38dab` — page_size override fix (the big one)
- `221798e` — removeWeight orphan + search + grouping collision

---

### NEXT SESSION: Backend Hardening (S60)

**Priority 1: Mock vs Real Path Audit**
Every `frontend/src/api/*.js` file has dual paths (`USE_MOCK` branches). Mock paths are well-tested, real paths have mismatches. Audit ALL:
- `rolls.js` — partially fixed S59, needs bulk endpoint
- `batches.js` — 7-state machine flow (assign→submit→check→pack), VA send/receive
- `lots.js` — create lot → distribute → batch creation
- `orders.js`, `invoices.js` — CRUD + pagination
- Check: pagination leaks, search mapping, response shapes, error handling

**Priority 2: Backend Invoice Layer**
- `POST /invoices/stock-in` — bulk atomic endpoint (single transaction, all-or-nothing). Replaces `stockInBulk` loop of 30 individual POSTs. No more partial saves, no duplicates on retry
- `GET /invoices` — server-side grouping with SQL `GROUP BY supplier_invoice_no, supplier_id`. Paginated, searchable. Replaces client-side fetch-all-and-group

**Priority 3: Full E2E Flow Test on Real Backend**
- Stock-in 30+ rolls → verify all saved → edit → verify order preserved
- Create lot from invoice → distribute → verify batches created
- Batch assign → tailor submit → checker QC → packing → verify state transitions
- VA send/receive (both roll and batch) → verify weight/pieces tracking
- Each step: compare mock behavior vs real backend behavior

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Batch System (S43-46)
- **7-state machine:** created → assigned → in_progress → submitted → checked → packing → packed
- **VA guard:** Can't submit/pack if BatchProcessing has `status='sent'`
- **Garment VA:** `BatchProcessing` (pieces) mirrors `RollProcessing` (kg). `BatchChallan` (BC-xxx) mirrors `JobChallan` (JC-xxx)
- **Packing:** Light — fields on Batch (packed_by, packed_at, pack_reference). `packed` fires `ready_stock_in`
- **Permissions:** 4 batch permissions configurable from Roles page. Backend: `require_permission()`. Frontend: `perms.batch_*`
- **`applicable_to`** on value_additions: `roll` / `garment` / `both`
- **Per-color QC:** `color_qc` JSON on Batch. Falls back to flat `approved_qty/rejected_qty`
- **SKU auto-gen at pack:** `find_or_create()` SKU = `{product_type}-{design}-{color}-{size}+{VA1}+{VA2}` → fire `ready_stock_in` per color
- **`product_type` on Lot:** BLS/KRT/SAR/DRS/OTH → flows lot → batch → SKU code

### Weight System (3 fields on Roll)
- `total_weight` — original supplier weight, **IMMUTABLE** after stock-in
- `current_weight` — post-VA weight (mutated by receive/update processing)
- `remaining_weight` — available for cutting/lots (mutated by send/receive/lot creation)
- Partial send: `weight_before` = amount sent (not full weight). Roll stays `in_stock` if `remaining_weight > 0`
- `JobChallanCreate.rolls` = `list[{roll_id, weight_to_send}]`

### Lot System
- Statuses: open → cutting → distributed (forward-only)
- Fields: `standard_palla_weight`, `standard_palla_meter`, `default_size_pattern` (JSON)
- `POST /lots/{id}/distribute` auto-creates batches from size pattern. `sku_id` nullable on batches
- Lot create overlay: full-page `fixed inset-0 z-50`, emerald gradient header

### QR & Scan System
- **Static QR, Dynamic Passport** — QR printed once, scan shows live DB data
- `/scan/roll/:roll_code` — PUBLIC, Roll Passport | `/scan/batch/:batch_code` — PUBLIC, Batch Passport
- `enhanced_roll_code` = `roll_code` + received VA short codes (computed, never stored)
- `effective_sku` = `BLS-101-Pink-M+EMB+SQN` (computed from base_sku + received VAs)
- QR sizes: 130px (print), 160px (screen scan)
- Scanner: Native `BarcodeDetector` on mobile Chrome 83+, `html5-qrcode` desktop fallback

### Value Additions
- `RollProcessing.value_addition_id` — REQUIRED FK (process_type removed S26)
- 10 seed VAs: EMB, DYE, DPT, HWK, SQN, BTC (roll/both) + HST, BTN, LCW, FIN (garment)
- Color map: EMB=purple, DYE=amber, DPT=sky, HWK=rose, SQN=pink, BTC=teal
- Job Challans: `POST /job-challans` atomic (creates challan + sends all rolls). Auto-sequential JC-001+

### PWA + Mobile (S38)
- Dual layout: Tailor/Checker → `MobileLayout` (bottom tabs), Admin/Supervisor/Billing → `Layout` (sidebar)
- BottomNav: 3 tabs — Scan / My Work (or QC Queue) / Profile
- Offline queue: `useOfflineQueue` hook, localStorage-persisted, auto-syncs on reconnect
- CORS dev tunnels: `allow_origin_regex=r"https://.*\.trycloudflare\.com"` — **remove for production**

### UI Patterns
- **Print:** `react-to-print` + `useReactToPrint({ contentRef })` + fixed overlay `z-50`, A4 inline styles
- **Typography:** Inter font (400-800), `.typo-label`/`.typo-data` CSS classes, DataTable `<th>` text-gray-600
- **Roll code:** `{SrNo}-{Fabric3}-{Color5/ColorNo}-{Seq}` (Sr. No. = internal filing serial)
- **SKU pattern:** `ProductType-DesignNo-Color-Size` (e.g. `BLS-101-Red-M`)
- **Response shapes:** All FK UUIDs return nested objects. Authority: `mock.js → API_REFERENCE.md → backend`

### SSE Real-Time (S53)
- Backend: `event_bus.py` singleton → `asyncio.Queue` per client → `GET /events/stream?token=<jwt>`
- Frontend: `NotificationContext.jsx` (EventSource + exponential backoff), `Toast.jsx`, `NotificationBell.jsx`
- 10 emit calls across 6 services. 30s heartbeat. Nginx: `proxy_buffering off; proxy_read_timeout 86400;`

### AWS Deployment (S42)
- **Frontend:** Vercel (free forever) — `vercel.json` SPA rewrites + `allowedHosts`
- **Backend:** AWS EC2 t2.micro + Nginx + Gunicorn + FastAPI (free 12 months)
- **Database:** AWS RDS PostgreSQL db.t3.micro (free 12 months)
- **Cost:** ₹0 year 1, ~₹2,300/mo after. Guide: `Guardian/AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md`

### PostgreSQL Migration (S53)
- SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL on AWS RDS only. `psycopg2-binary` for Alembic sync
- Seeds cleaned: removed Suppliers/SKUs/Fabrics (add from Masters page). Kept ProductTypes/Colors/VAs
- Old migrations deleted. Fresh `alembic revision --autogenerate` on deploy target
- `DATABASE_URL`: `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./inventory_os.db` → `postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:5432/inventory_os`
